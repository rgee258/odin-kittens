## Kittens App

This repo contains a simple Rails app which serves as a basic API.

The app contains kittens, each containing a name, age, level of cuteness, and level of softness.
Users are able to access kittens as a resource using JSON through the API. Requests for JSON
can be performed on both of the index/root actions in localhost:#### or localhost:####/kittens
and on the show action in localhost:####/kittens/id. Requests will retrieve a kitten's attributes
from creation and their id in JSON format.

This app in this repo is the result of building a basic API using Rails for the first time.

This project is done following The Odin Project, which this project in particular can
