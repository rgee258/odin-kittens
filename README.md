## Kittens App

This repo contains a simple Rails app which serves as a basic API.

The app contains kittens, each containing a name, age, level of cuteness, and level of softness.
Users will be able to access kittens as a resource using JSON through the API.

This app in this repo is the result of building a basic API using Rails for the first time.
